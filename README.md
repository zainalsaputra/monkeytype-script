# Monkeytype Puppeteer Automation Script

A Node.js script that utilizes Puppeteer to automate typing tests on monkeytype.com.

This project was developed for educational purposes, specifically to demonstrate how Puppeteer can automate browser input at a level that is recognized as "trusted" by the browser (bypassing the `event.isTrusted` check).

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
* npm (which is included with Node.js)

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Clone this repository or create a new directory and place the `index.js` script inside it.
2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3.  Initialize a new Node.js project:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
4.  Install the required Puppeteer dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install puppeteer
    ```
    This command will download both the Puppeteer library and a compatible version of Chromium.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
2.  The script will launch a new Chromium browser window (in non-headless mode) and navigate to `https://monkeytype.com`.
3.  The terminal will display the following message:
    ```
    You have 5 seconds to click/setup in the browser...
    ```
4.  During this 5-second window, you **must** click inside the browser window to focus the test and ensure it is active.
5.  After the delay, the script will:
    * Scrape all visible words from the test interface.
    * Begin typing the words using `page.keyboard.type()`, simulating human-like input with a 50ms delay between keystrokes.
6.  Upon completion, the script will pause for 10 seconds to allow for result inspection before automatically closing the browser.
